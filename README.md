# SpecialCharacterLookup

Are you a non-native English struggling speaker like me? Have you even been in the embrassing situation that you don't know how to pronouce special characters such as / or { or ? in the talk just like me?

Unfornately, it's not easy for us to learn them. These characters are not in the textbook, not in the dictionary and hard to search in Google. 

So I develop this tool to look up speical characters. just input any charcater and I'll return you the name.
